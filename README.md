## **Hello my name is Luis and welcome to my profile**

Hello, how are you, my name is Luis Sanchez, I am 17 years old, I am passionate about programming and I am currently studying programming, I consider myself self-taught because I learned most of my knowledge on my own, my career only helped me to understand the basic concepts and logic of programming.

I currently consider myself a junior developer with knowledge in the following languages:

- SQL - Low Level
- CSS/SCSS - Low Level
- Java - Intermediate Level
- HTML - Intermediate Level
- Python - Intermediate Level
- JavaScript - Intermediate Level

Two of my future plans are to get into video game programming and machine learning.
